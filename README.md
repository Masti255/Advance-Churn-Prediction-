# Advance-Churn-Prediction-
# Churn Prediction Model for Telecom Company (12 Million Subscribers)

Project Overview
This repository contains a churn prediction model designed to analyze historical customer data from a telecom company with 12 million subscribers. The model aims to identify subscribers at high risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies.

This can be incredibly valuable for:

Reducing customer churn: By proactively identifying at-risk customers, you can take steps to retain them, such as offering personalized discounts or addressing their needs.
Improving customer satisfaction: By understanding customer churn patterns, you can tailor your services and offerings to better meet their expectations.
Optimizing marketing campaigns: By focusing on customers most likely to churn, you can improve the efficiency of your marketing efforts.
Installation
Dependencies:

This project relies on several Python libraries. To install them, run the following command in your terminal:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended) and pip (the package installer) configured.

Usage
1. Prepare your data:

The model expects your customer data in a specific format. Please refer to the data folder for an example of the expected structure. Make sure your data is formatted accordingly.

2. Run the model:

You can train and evaluate the model using the provided script:

Bash

python churn_prediction.py
This script will:

Load the data.
Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
Train the churn prediction model.
Evaluate the model's performance on a holdout set.
(Optional) Save the trained model for future use.
3. Explore the results:

The script will output metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance. You can use this information to assess the model's effectiveness and make adjustments as needed.

4. Make predictions (optional):

If you have saved the trained model, you can use it to predict the churn probability for new customer data. The script can be modified to include such functionality (seek further guidance for specific implementation).

Examples
Input:

Python

# Sample customer data (replace with your actual data)
customer_id = 12345
tenure = 24  # Months with the company
monthly_charges = 50.0
contract_type = "One Year"  # Categorical variable
# ... other customer features
Output:

Predicted churn probability: 0.3 (30% chance)
Note: This is a hypothetical example. The actual probability output will depend on your model and training data.
